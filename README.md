## Prerequisites (for Manual Setup)

If you prefer not to use Docker, you‚Äôll need:

- Python 3.10+
- MariaDB 10.5+ or MySQL
- Redis
- Node.js & npm (only if building front-end assets manually)

---

## Configuration

Environment variables are loaded from `.env` (automatically picked up by Docker Compose):

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_secure_key
DB_USER=finance_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=finance_tracker
FLASK_CONFIG=config.config.PortableConfig
```

Use `.env_default` as a starting point.

>‚ö†Ô∏è**Security Warning**  Never commit `.env`, `.env.prod`, or any file containing credentials, secrets, or keys. Use `.gitignore`, Docker secrets, or environment variables in production.

---

## Multi-Platform Docker Builds

Build and push Docker images for multiple platforms:

- App image: Tags include `${APP_VERSION}` and `latest`
- Nginx image: Tags include `nginx-${APP_VERSION}` and `nginx`

All images are built using `docker buildx` with `--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64`.

Prebuilt images are available on Docker Hub for use with `docker-compose.yml` from each release.

---

## Security Notes

- Passwords are securely hashed using Werkzeug  
- Sessions are managed via Redis  
- CSRF protection enabled (Flask-WTF)  
- Nginx reverse proxy supports HTTPS (TLS certificate config required)  
- Avoid committing `.env` or `.env.prod` files with secrets
